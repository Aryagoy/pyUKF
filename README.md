# A general unscented kalman filter
Written by Basel Alghanem at the University of Michigan ROAHM Lab and based on "The Unscented Kalman Filter for Nonlinear Estimation" by Wan, E. A., & Van Der Merwe, R. (2000). This python unscented kalman filter (UKF) implementation supports multiple measurement updates (even simultaneously) and allows you to easily plug in your model and measurements!

# Examples
Trying out the first example (example.py) should be really easy. It reads data from a provided csv and demonstrates the core functionality in a simple case. More info to come!

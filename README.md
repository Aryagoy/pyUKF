# A general unscented kalman filter
Written by Basel Alghanem at the University of Michigan ROAHM Lab and based on "The Unscented Kalman Filter for Nonlinear Estimation" by Wan, E. A., & Van Der Merwe, R. (2000). This python unscented kalman filter (UKF) implementation supports multiple measurement updates and allows you to easily plug in your model and measurements! Examples to come.
